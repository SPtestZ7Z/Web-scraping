            "\n",
            "Sir Keir Starmer has said any Ukraine peace deal would require a \"US backstop\" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. Speaking after a hastily convened meeting with European leaders in Paris, the prime minister repeated that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement. But he said \"a US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia\", and vowed to discuss the \"key elements\" of a peace deal with US President Donald Trump when the pair meet in Washington next week. Sir Keir said Europe would \"have to do more\" to defend the continent in the face of the \"generational\" security challenge Russia poses.\n",
            "\n",
            "European leaders convened at the Élysée Palace to discuss concerns over the Trump administration's decision to initiate peace talks with Russia - due to start in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday - alone. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv did not know about the talks and would not recognise any agreement made without its involvement. US officials have suggested European nations would be consulted on peace talks with Russia, but not directly involved in them. The swiftly-arranged summit in Paris also took place days after US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said Europe would have to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward. In his statement to reporters following the Paris talks, Sir Keir said the US was \"not going to leave Nato\", but that it was \"time to take responsibility for our security, our continent\". Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said transatlantic relations were in a \"new stage\", and that the meeting had confirmed the time had come for \"a much greater ability for Europe to defend itself\". Sir Keir first indicated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine in an article for the Daily Telegraph. The UK's contribution would be part of a multinational force to police the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory. But experts say to do so effectively would be a massive undertaking that would require a large increase in defence spending. Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that, unlike UN peacekeeping forces there to observe, if the force being proposed is intended to deter Russian attacks, \"it's a whole different matter altogether\". \"You need credible, well-armed forces - and you not only need frontline forces, you need back-up forces, and air forces, and so on,\" he told the BBC. \"That's a much bigger ask.\" General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, a former Nato commander, said: \"This cannot be a token force, it cannot be something that observes bad behaviour and stands on the sideline.\" He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that it would have to do \"effectively what Nato does on its own turf - really deter aggression\", and would need to be \"underpinned by a grand strategy for containment of Russia\" that would make clear any future conflict would not be contained to Ukraine. \"Essentially, the force needs to be large enough to defeat an incursion,\" he added. The former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, previously estimated such a force would need around 100,000 troops - with the UK contributing about two-fifths. \"We just haven't got that number available,\" he said on Saturday, adding that getting the military into shape to perform this role would come at a considerable cost. The UK currently spends around 2.3% of its total economic output on defence. The government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, but has not said when this will be achieved. Sir Keir earlier told reporters that the government would set out a path to meeting the 2.5% commitment once it finishes its strategic defence review. \"Part of my message to our European allies is that we've all got to step up on both capability and on spending and funding,\" he said. \"That includes the UK, which is why I've made that commitment to spend more.\"\n",

On Tuesday Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio are due to meet in the Saudi capital. Ukraine is not attending either set of talks. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently controls more than a fifth of its territory, mainly in the south and east.\n",

            "The UK By Harry Farley, Political Correspondent in London Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to be a bridge between European leaders and Trump's White House berating them about their defence spending. Starmer's offer to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine is part of that role he wants to play. The government used to say the terms of any peace deal was up to Ukraine. That has shifted with the new US administration signalling that a return to 2014 borders was \"unrealistic\". Instead Sir Keir will be hoping more European nations in Paris join him in offering their forces to secure a deal – and prevent Russia invading again. But while the prime minister is in Paris, in Westminster the debate goes on about how much the country should spend on defence. Labour has promised to \"set out a path\" to increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP now to 2.5%. Defence sources say that would be a significant rise. But there is no date for when that would happen - and many argue it is now urgent.\n",

            "Germany By Damien McGuinness, Germany correspondent in Berlin It is a sign of how rattled German leaders are by Trump's approach to Ukraine that just days before a national election Chancellor Olaf Scholz is also in Paris. All mainstream parties have condemned American suggestions that a peace deal be brokered without Ukraine or the EU. Far-right and populist-left politicians welcome talks with Putin and want to stop arming Kyiv. But they will not get into power. So, whatever the next German government looks like, Berlin's support for Ukraine will remain strong. That is because Berlin's political elite recognises that a bad deal - one that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty - would be disastrous for Germany. But with Germany's war-torn 20th century in mind, voters here are wary of militarisation. Over the past three years the country has successfully pivoted away from Russian energy and massively upped defence spending. But this has hit the German economy hard and the subsequent budget rows sparked the collapse of the German government. So politicians are trying to avoid public discussions of difficult issues, like higher Nato spending targets or German peacekeeping troops in Ukraine — at least until after the election.\n",

            "Poland By Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent in Warsaw Poland has been a key supporter of Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion and it is the key logistics hub for military and humanitarian aid entering the country. It is also a loud voice arguing that Russia cannot be allowed to win the war it launched – because the whole of Europe's security is at stake. So there is consternation that the US looks like it is conceding to Moscow's key demands, even before talks begin, when Poland very clearly sees Russia as the aggressor and as dangerous. Russia is why Poland spends big on its own military – up to almost 5% of GDP now - and agrees with the US that the rest of Europe should do the same. On his way to the talks in Paris, Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: \"If we, Europeans, fail to spend big on defence now, we will be forced to spend 10 times more if we don't prevent a wider war.\" On the question of whether to send Polish troops to Ukraine – to help enforce any eventual ceasefire - government officials have been cautious, ruling it out for now.\n",

            "The Nordic and Baltic countries By Nick Beake, Europe Correspondent in Copenhagen Denmark will be the only Nordic nation at Monday's meeting. But European diplomats say it will also be representing the interests of its Baltic neighbours to the east – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – all of whom border Russia and feel particularly vulnerable to any future Putin attack. The shockwaves generated by the second Trump term have already been reverberating around Denmark. Trump's renewed desire to take over Greenland – an autonomous Danish dependent territory - propelled Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on a whistle-stop tour of European allies last month to shore up support. On Monday in Paris, Frederiksen finds herself once again in a hastily-convened meeting to respond to Trump's reshaping of the transatlantic security landscape. Frederiksen has not yet followed in Starmer's footsteps of pledging peacekeeping boots on the ground in Ukraine. Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen has been quoted by Danish media as saying he is not ruling it out – but that it is too early to talk about.\n",

            "France By Andrew Harding, Paris correspondent French President Emmanuel Macron called Monday's informal meeting – not a \"summit,\" his officials insisted – to help Europe coordinate a response both to Washington's increasingly unsympathetic posture towards the continent, and to whatever emerges from the White House's fast-paced negotiations with the Kremlin. \"The Europeans, as we speak, are not coordinated, but that may be the whole point of (this) summit in Paris, and that is the beginning of coordination… Are we ready? The answer is no. Can we get ready? The answer is yes,\" said Francois Heisbourg, a veteran French military expert, commenting on the need for Europe to work together to prepare a possible peacekeeping force for Ukraine. \"There is a wind of unity blowing across Europe such as has not been seen since Covid,\" said Jean-Noël Barrot, France's most senior diplomat. The mood in France – a nation always wary of American geopolitical manoeuvring – is particularly edgy right now, with newspaper headlines warning of a new \"Trump-Putin axis\" that will sideline or \"abandon\" Europe over the war in Ukraine. \"We should be in a Europe-wide state of emergency,\" warned the former Prime Minister Dominique De Villepin at a recent news briefing, accusing an \"arrogant\" Trump of attempting to \"rule the world without principles or respect.\"\n",

            "Russia By Liza Fokht, BBC Russian in Paris Since the summer, Putin has stated that his main conditions for starting negotiations to end the war are the recognition of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, the lifting of sanctions on Russia, and denial of Ukraine's request to join Nato. Most European countries categorically reject these demands. The US has been very cautious in discussing what concessions Russia might have to make, though both the White House and the Pentagon have said they expect compromises from \"both sides\". Moscow's priority is clearly the meeting in Saudi Arabia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he would \"first and foremost like to listen\" to the American proposals on ending the conflict in Ukraine. As for Europe, Moscow sees no point in inviting it to the negotiating table. It is no secret that for many years Putin has sought dialogue specifically with the US – a country he both blames for starting the war in Ukraine and considers the only power equal to Russia. Moscow may take note of Starmer's statements about being ready to send peacekeepers to the Ukraine – for the first time in a week, the discussion is about potential Russian, rather than Ukrainian, concessions. But whether Russia is ready for any compromises remains an open question.\n",
            "\n",
            "The US By Bernd Debusmann Jr reporting from Mar-a-Lago, Florida Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff will be the public face of the US team negotiating in Riyadh - but perhaps the main voice at the table is more than 7,400 miles (11,900km) away, in Palm Beach, Florida. Despite Trump's public engagements in recent days, it is clear that the negotiations with Russia over the fate of Ukraine have been his focus behind the scenes. On Sunday, Trump told reporters he had been kept abreast of the latest developments and the talks are \"moving along\". His short-term goal is to stop the fighting in Ukraine. Longer term, he appears to want less American involvement, given that the US has sent tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Kyiv. Trump has also pushed for access to rare minerals in Ukraine in return for aid, or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided. But he has not yet said what a post-war Ukraine would look like, setting off alarm bells in Europe. He also notably said that he expects Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to be a part of the \"conversation\", but not the talks in Riyadh. Rubio has said the talks in Saudi Arabia are only the start of a longer process that will \"obviously\" include Europe and Ukraine. Those remarks are likely to provide little comfort for US allies who have been listening to Trump's remarks over the last several days. In response to a BBC question on Wednesday, Trump said he believes he is inclined to agree with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's assessment that a return to pre-2014 borders is unrealistic for Ukraine, although he expects Ukraine might get \"some\" of that land back. So far, it appears that solution is not one that is palatable for Zelensky and the rest of Ukraine's leadership.\n",

The Supreme Court case set for April will rule on whether lenders should have clearly told customers how much commission they were making from selling car loans. The Court of Appeal ruled last year that lenders should have been clearer, but the lenders are appealing this ruling in April's case. The Treasury attempted to intervene last month due to concerns the ruling would reduce the availability of car loans. It told the BBC it respected Monday's Supreme Court decision to block its intervention.\n",

            "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements. In 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate. Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people who had these deals before 2021. That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds. Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation. Some analysts estimate total payments could reach as much as £30bn in a scandal that could end up being the largest compensation scheme regarding financial products since the payment protection insurance (PPI) saga.\n",

            "A friend of a female soldier has told an inquest into her death that women in the Army are often subjected to \"humiliating\" comments and \"vicious gossip\" from male colleagues. Royal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck, 19, was found dead in her barracks at Larkhill Camp, Wiltshire, on 15 December 2021 following a block party on site. Tamzin Hort, who has since left the Army, said female soldiers receive \"unwanted attention\" from men, and are branded with sexist slurs if they refuse advances. The inquest has heard how Gunner Beck had been subjected to relentless harassment by her line manager and had been \"pinned down\" by a sergeant who tried to kiss her.\n",
            "\n",
            "Family Handout Gunner Beck (unblurred) said life in the Army would \"be so different if [she] was a lad\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Hort told the court she recognised this inappropriate and predatory behaviour from her own experience in the Army. \"I was with my partner for three years but as the only girl in my battery, I got a lot of unwanted attention from a lot of the lads - especially if they'd had a drink,\" she said. \"I couldn't walk out of my block without getting nasty comments.\" The former soldier said women were frequently called degrading and \"disgusting\" names, which would eventually add up. \"I put on weight due to my relationship and things going wrong,\" she said. \"I would go to work every morning and get called fat by my training instructor. \"He would say 'look at you, you are fat, are you pregnant?' You are just sat there humiliated. \"If you're told enough times, that affects you. It makes you feel very low.\"\n",

She described one incident, aged 17, in which she returned home from the pub only to find a sergeant outside her room holding a condom. \"You can imagine how scared I was. It happens to every female, not just in 47 Regiment.\" She added she did not report the incident because on one occasion, when she received therapy through the Army welfare services, \"somehow everyone knew about it\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Family Handout Male colleagues would make unsolicited comments about Gunner Beck's appearance, the inquest was told\n",

            "Ms Hort said although Gunner Beck had never personally confided in her about any similar incidents of sexual harassment, she had overheard plenty. \"She was beautiful, she was going to get comments, but she shouldn't have had to. \"They would all make disgusting comments like 'I would do this to her'. \"You can't react to it because it makes it worse, and they would do it even more.\" The nine-day hearing, which began at Salisbury Coroner's Court on 10 February, heard how Gunner Beck had repeatedly tried to establish boundaries with her male colleagues, but her efforts were ignored. In the two months leading up to her death, Bombardier Ryan Mason sent the 19-year-old more than 4,600 messages confessing his feelings for her. Gunner Beck's ex-boyfriend, George Higgins, said Mr Mason had also shown her a 15-page \"love story\" he had written, detailing his \"fantasies about her\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Solent News Mr Mason told the court he \"couldn't remember\" Gunner Beck asking him to back off\n",
            "\n",
            "In a WhatsApp message, Gunner Beck revealed she felt \"genuinely trapped\" by his behaviour, which had taken a \"huge toll\" on her mental health. She wrote: \"I'm trying to be there for you as a friend but it completely crossed the line of that a long time ago. I feel so uncomfortable.\" Lance Bombardier Jones, a close friend of Gunner Beck's, told the inquest on Thursday that she never reported this behaviour out of fear it would damage her reputation. He explained that \"she didn't want be seen as a serial accuser\" after making a previous complaint against Battery Sergeant Major Michael Webber a few months prior, following an attempted sexual advance at a work social. In a text message to a friend, she wrote: \"I haven't done anything wrong, I know that, but it looks [bad] on me. I'm so pissed off with this situation now. \"I'm the only female, so people will begin to think 'oh she's making her way round everyone'. It would be so different if I was a lad.\" An Army service inquiry report published in October 2023, said this was \"possibly a factor that may have influenced her failure to report other events that happened subsequently\". It also detailed three additional \"contributory factors\" to her death: The \"significant strain\" of a sexual relationship with a married colleague in the last few weeks of her life. A relationship that ended in November 2021 which involved \"repeated allegations of unfaithfulness on the part of the boyfriend\". An \"unhealthy approach to alcohol, with episodes of binge-drinking\". The hearing continues.\n",

            "\n",
            "A nurse who is in the middle of an employment tribunal against NHS Fife has been called to a separate disciplinary hearing by the health board. Sandie Peggie claims she was subjected to unlawful harassment by being made to share a changing room at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, with Dr Beth Upton - who is a transgender woman. Her claim is disputed by the health board and the doctor. On Friday, the tribunal judge adjourned the case until July. The BBC has learned that NHS Fife has scheduled a conduct hearing to examine allegations against Ms Peggie of misconduct, failures of patient care and misgendering Dr Upton. The potential outcomes range from no case to dismissal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The hearing was originally due to take place on Friday but has been rescheduled at Ms Peggie's request. In response, her legal team are planning further action in the form of another tribunal claim. NHS Fife said it was unable to comment on matters relating to individual staff members.\n",
            "\n",
            "The employment tribunal previously heard how Ms Peggie had encountered Dr Upton in the women's changing room on two occasions in August and late October or early November 2023. Ms Peggie, who has been a nurse at NHS Fife for more than 30 years, said she felt \"uncomfortable\" and waited outside of the room until Dr Upton left. On a third occasion on Christmas Eve 2023, the pair exchanged words in the room and Ms Peggie said the doctor should not be using the women's changing area. Both sides have disputed exactly what was said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr Beth Upton made a bullying and harassment complaint about Sandie Peggie\n",
            "\n",
            "During her evidence, Ms Peggie confirmed she had called Dr Upton a man and said she believed the medic was a biological male. She acknowledged that this would be considered harassment under NHS Fife's diversity and equality guidance. Dr Upton told the tribunal the incident was \"quite scary\" and claimed the nurse compared the situation to the case of Isla Bryson, a transgender rapist who attacked two women while known as Adam Graham and was initially remanded to a women's prison. \"I felt really distressed, really awful,\" the doctor added. \"I've never had somebody say things like that to me before.\" Dr Upton complained and the nurse was put on leave. She was then suspended for eight weeks while the health board carried out an investigation into alleged bullying and harassment.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Ms Peggie said it was discriminatory for Dr Upton, who was not registered female at birth, to use the women's changing room. The nurse claims she was \"subjected to sexual harassment\" by the medic and that NHS Fife had breached the Equality Act. NHS guidance states that trans men and women are allowed to use the changing rooms that align with their gender identity. Ms Peggie also criticised how long the investigation into the bullying allegations had taken and said she had not been asked for her side of the story. In January, it was decided that the tribunal would be heard in public and that Ms Peggie and her legal team were allowed to refer to Dr Upton as a man. After two weeks of evidence, the hearing was expected to have concluded. The delay is due to questioning of witnesses taking longer than anticipated, and the judge and lawyers' availability. So far, Ms Peggie, Dr Upton and nursing manager Esther Davidson have given evidence among others.\n",

I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\" Eisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor.

Despite ratings which are far below their 1980s peak, EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale consistently rank in the top 20 most viewed shows on UK broadcast channels every week. With EastEnders celebrating its 40th anniversary and ITV cutting back soaps in the schedule, I decided it was time to finally watch a soap opera.

Sitting down to a watch a soap for the first time, I was unsure what to expect. I had never heard anyone my age talk about them before and navigating to ITVX and having to sit through three minutes of adverts was a very different experience from what I'm used to.

Although the drama gets progressively more absurd, the sheer amount of scheming and fighting that is crammed into such a short episode means I was hooked for most of the show. But, I also had a lot of questions about how true the shows are to reality. How is everyone out and about all day? Don't they have to go to work? Would neighbours really be that aggressive with each other face to face? Realistically, their gripes would play out with passive aggressive messages on the neighbourhood WhatsApp group How can people afford to be buying that many drinks in the pub every night? Why does everyone visit the laundrette on a daily basis? Does no one own a washing machine? Why do they all buy a cup of tea at the local cafe when they only live 100 metres away?\n",

Only last week, a clip from a Spanish reality TV programme showing a man having a meltdown as he watches a clip of his girlfriend cheating on him went viral. You can't convince me that watching a man run along a beach howling after learning about his partner's infidelity doesn't make for more engaging TV than a couple shouting faux insults at each other in the laundrette.\n",

Shots are dimly lit, characters stand around in dated kitchens and conversations last a few minutes before flitting to another storyline entirely.

In the past, these storylines would have undoubtedly influenced national conversations but for me, it felt like the issues were dealt with heavy-handedly and often felt shoehorned into plotlines. In comparison to shows such as Sex Education, Euphoria, and Top Boy which resonate with younger audiences by addressing themes like mental health, identity, and social justice in a way that feels authentic and visually compelling, the teenage angst of characters like Betsy and Max in Coronation Street feel unrealistic. I realise it's unfair to compare the big-budget streamer hits with soaps. The first season of Euphoria which consisted of just eight episodes reportedly cost $165m (£130m) to produce which is far greater than the budget of soaps. But, even up against shows such as Made in Chelsea, which likely has a similar budget, soaps still perform poorly with young audiences. Around a quarter of Made in Chelsea's audience is aged 16 to 34.\n",

The tech giant said Project Waterworth - connecting the US, India, South Africa, Brazil and other regions - will be the world's longest underwater cable project when completed. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has sought to extend its presence in technology beyond social media, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and the infrastructure that supports it. It said its new cable project would provide \"industry-leading connectivity\" to five major continents and help support its AI projects.\n",

Sub-sea cables have become increasingly important as they provide the means to power a variety of digital services and transfer data worldwide at speed. One regularly-cited statistic suggests more than 95% of the world's internet traffic is transferred through undersea cables. Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography says there are currently more than 600 publicly-known sub-sea cable systems worldwide.

Google said in 2024 it would build the first sub-sea cable connecting Africa and Australia, and announced a $1bn investment to boost connectivity to Japan with two new sub-sea cables in the Pacific Ocean. \"Over the past decade there has been a shift in which these cables are increasingly laid by large technology companies,\" Professor Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute told the BBC. He said this is in contrast to the past, where underwater cables were laid and financed by large groups of national telecoms firms, due to their considerable investment needs. Prof Lehdonvirta said this reflects the growing size and position of big tech firms to be able to fund such infrastructure independently - something that \"may be significant to policy makers concerned with concentration in digital markets\". Telecoms and technology industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said it spoke to Meta's ambitions. \"Meta has shown a strong desire to own more of the connectivity slice,\" he told the BBC. \"This is a further demonstration as it seeks to leapfrog rivals in providing users with an unique experience by tightly integrating hardware, software, platform and its growing aspirations in connectivity,\" he added.\n",

            "Mr Williams and his wife put the house on the market in April 2024 but said they had had little interest from potential buyers, despite dropping the price by £40,000. \"I put it down to all the other properties in the village that are up for sale at the moment,\" he said. Mr Williams believes some of the interventions by the council have prompted a lot of people to sell, while also putting off potential buyers. Cyngor Gwynedd has been trying to address the shortage of housing for local people in tourist areas and has more than doubled the council tax charge on second and holiday homes.\n",

North Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy described the housing market in Gwynedd as \"mixed\", with local interventions on second homes leading to \"more properties coming on to the market\". But he said the price of a second home was often \"outside the affordability of the local purchaser\". \"What we need to see is balance in the market,\" he said, including \"more house building as far as first-time buyers are concerned\".\n",

Factors such as interest rates, regional job opportunities, interventions in the local housing market by a council and even the number of transactions can all have an impact on house prices. It means there is some uncertainty about what caused the drop in prices in Gwynedd in the year to December.\n",
